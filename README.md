# Dragon Quest Playthrough Data Analysis Project
---

Welcome to my Dragon Quest Playthrough repo. As a huge fan of the Dragon Quest series and gaming in general, and as a lover of collecting, processing, and playing with data, I decided to once again play the original USA version of Dragon Quest for NES from 1986 (known as Dragon Warrior at that time) and collect all of the data produced during the playthrough.

Why? Just for fun mostly. But also because I think it's possible due to the simplistic text-based nature of this historical masterpiece of a video game. And I think it will help me learn some new techniques to add to my data arsenal. Bonus points - it's a short game!

How? Well, I've separated the data from this game into two separate categories: game data and playthrough data. I consider game data to be all aspects of the game that are fixed parameters. For example, character and monster stats, item costs, spell effects, and equipment bonuses are all game data. Playthrough data, on the other hand, consists of all actions I take or events that occur while playing the game. Each monster I battle, damage dealt and received in combat, spells I cast, and treasures I find are all examples of playthrough data. I plan to collect this data primarily by recording videos of the playthrough, then converting those videos into a series of images from which I may extract text that can be then be processed and stored in a database.

To be honest, I'm not sure what kinds of discoveries this data will hold or exactly what I want to do with it yet because I don't have a specific "business question" or problem that I am trying to solve by collecting this data. But I think it will be super fun to look at things like how the distribution of monsters I face changes over time, overall damage numbers from different monsters or in different dungeons, and how much healing I had to do to stay in the game.

Finally, because this game is very outdated, it can be quite... boring to play, by today's standards. I don't mean to suggest that I don't like this game, because I do. I love it in fact, if only for nostalgia's sake. But to spice it up a bit, I've added three self-imposed rules to my playthrough that will likely change how the data might look for a "typical" first-timer play of this game:

1) Zero deaths. If ever my character is defeated, I must start over at level 1 (don't worry, I won't let it happen).
2) No running from battle. Pretty self-explanatory.
3) 100% completion. That means I need to find all items and reach max level.

So basically, this playthrough is going to be a total grindfest. But that's kind of all this game ever was anyway (said with much love). I am also live-streaming all playthrough sessions so that my friends can stop by and keep me company through the monotonous gameplay.
